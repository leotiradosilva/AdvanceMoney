# The Insurance Claim CorDapp

This CorDapp is an example of how Insurance Claim can be settled confidentially. For example, an Applicant can submit an Insurance claim
with the Insurance Company giving required details and claim Amount. The Insurance Company can then forward the Claim request to the Underwriting agency.
Communication between any of the Parties or any data exchanged remains private to Parties. Applicant does not hear what Insurance Company and Underwriter does.

The CorDapp includes:

* A Claim State definition that records the Applicant details required by the Insurance Company.
* An Underwriter State definition to handle the underwriting process.
* Two contracts, one that facilitates the verification of Insurance Claim and other that verifies the Underwriting process.
* Four flows for creating Insurance Claim Application, Forwarding the Application to Underwriting, Underwriter verifying it and responding with the Approved claim amount and finally Insurance Companny reverting the approval details to the Applicant

The CorDapp allows you to create an Insurance Claim and get it approved by the Underwriter. The Insurance Company can further carry out the Underwriting Process.
The CorDapp also comes with an API and UI layer that allows you to do all of the aforementioned things.

# Instructions for setting up

1. `git clone https://github.com/Manila-Gauns/Cordapp-InsuranceClaim
2. `cd cordapp-insuranceClaim`
3. `./gradlew deployNodes` - building may take upto a minute (it's much quicker if you already have the Corda binaries)./r
4. `cd kotlin-source/build/nodes`
5. `./runnodes`

At this point you will have a notary node running as well as three other nodes and their corresponding webservers. There should be 7 console windows in total. One for the notary and two for each of the three nodes. The nodes take about 20-30 seconds to finish booting up.
